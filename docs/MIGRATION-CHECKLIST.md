## Notes

- All migration tasks should reference [WORKER-PURPOSE.md](https://github.com/awesomeapibrasil/gateway/blob/main/WORKER-PURPOSE.md) for detailed specifications
- Each phase should be completed and validated before proceeding to the next
- Regular checkpoints should be established to assess progress and adjust timeline
- Risk mitigation strategies should be reviewed and updated throughout the migration
- Success metrics should be monitored continuously and reported regularly
